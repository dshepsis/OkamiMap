## Formatting
We have a [.prettierrc](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html) file which you use with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html) to style files with. Ignore it if you want; it's completely fine. But if you would like to use it, [here's the installation instructions for it](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html). Then, either install the plugin for your editor/IDE and use that, or simply smash `npx prettier --write .` into your console.
